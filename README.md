# Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Image_Classification_using-Keras

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks. CNNs represent a huge breakthrough in image recognition. They’re most commonly used to analyze visual imagery and are frequently working behind the scenes in image classification. They can be found at the core of everything from Facebook’s photo tagging to self-driving cars. They’re working hard behind the scenes in everything from healthcare to security.

In this project, we will build a convolutional neural network and train it on 8000 labelled images of cats and dogs (4000 each). Later we have 2000 images for validation.
This project resulted in accuracy of 80% on test images.

We will also look at ways of saving the model and then reloading the model. As Neural networks take huge time for learning. Once learned, we can reuse the model for classification on new data.
